# Write a program that accepts a date in the
# form month/day/year and outÂ­ puts whether or

# (September has only 30 days.)


# Modified function yearLength from
# datediff.py. Returns a boolean instead
# of a number

  # can make your program vulnerable to attacks.

  # in the function isValidDate, it would have

  # to print afterwards. For example, I could write
  print("The date {0}/{1}-{2} is {3}.".format(

      month,
      year,
      "working" if isValidDate(date, month, year) else "not working"
