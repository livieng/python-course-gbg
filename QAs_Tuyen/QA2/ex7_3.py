# A certain CS professor gives 100-point
# exams that are graded on the scale
# 90-100:A, 80-89:B, 70-79:C, 60-69:0, <60:F.
# Write a program that acÂ­ cepts an exam
# score as input and uses a decision structure
# to calculate the corresponding grade.


# This exercise is very similar to 7_2, but now
# we need to consider ranges too. We check
# if a score is greater than or equal to a
# grade limit. In 7_2, we only needed to check
# with equality.
